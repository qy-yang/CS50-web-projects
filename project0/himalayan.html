                <h4>Geology</h4>
                <p>The Himalayan range is one of the youngest mountain ranges on the planet and consists mostly of
                    uplifted sedimentary and metamorphic rock. According to the modern theory of plate tectonics, its
                    formation is a result of a continental collision or orogeny along the convergent boundary between
                    the Indo-Australian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. The Arakan Yoma highlands in Myanmar and the
                    Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal were also formed as a result of this collision.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Hydrology</h4>
                <p>Despite their scale, the Himalayas do not form a major watershed, and a number of rivers cut through
                    the range, particularly in the eastern part of the range. As a result, the main ridge of the
                    Himalayas is not clearly defined, and mountain passes are not as significant for traversing the
                    range as with other mountain ranges.
                </p>
                <strong>Glaciers</strong>
                <p>
                    The great ranges of central Asia, including the Himalayas, contain the third-largest deposit of ice
                    and snow in the world, after Antarctica and the Arctic. The Himalayan range encompasses about
                    15,000 glaciers, which store about 12,000 km3 (2,900 cu mi) of fresh water. Its glaciers include
                    the Gangotri and Yamunotri (Uttarakhand) and Khumbu glaciers (Mount Everest region), Langtang
                    glacier (Langtang region) and Zemu (Sikkim).
                </p>
                <strong>Lakes</strong>
                <p>
                    The Himalayan region is dotted with hundreds of lakes. Most of the larger lakes are on the northern
                    side of the main range. These include the sacred freshwater Lake Manasarovar, near to Mount Kailas
                    with an area of 420 km2 (160 sq mi) and an altitude of 4,590 m (15,060 ft). It drains into the
                    nearby Lake Rakshastal with an area of 250 km2 (97 sq mi) and slightly lower at 4,575 m (15,010 ft).
                    Pangong Tso, which is spread across the border between India and China, at far western end of Tibet,
                    and Yamdrok Tso, located in south central Tibet, are among the largest with surface areas of 700 km2
                    (270 sq mi), and 638 km2 (246 sq mi), respectively. Lake Puma Yumco is one of the highest of the
                    larger lakes at an elevation of 5,030 m (16,500 ft).
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Ecology</h4>
                <p>The flora and fauna of the Himalayas vary with climate, rainfall, altitude, and soils. The climate
                    ranges from tropical at the base of the mountains to permanent ice and snow at the highest
                    elevations. The amount of yearly rainfall increases from west to east along the southern front of
                    the range. This diversity of altitude, rainfall and soil conditions combined with the very high snow
                    line supports a variety of distinct plant and animal communities. The extremes of high altitude (low
                    atmospheric pressure) combined with extreme cold favor extremophile organisms.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Culture</h4>
                <p>The Himalayan population belongs to four distinct cultural groups, who throughout history have
                    systematically penetrated the isolated indigenous Himalayan population. Those migrating cultures –
                    Hindu (Indian), Buddhist (Tibetan), Islamic (Afghanistan–Iranian) and Animist (Burmese and southeast
                    Asian) – have created here their own individual and unique place.[5] Their current arrangement,
                    though with a few exceptions, is linked to specific geographical regions, and the relative altitude
                    at which they occur.
